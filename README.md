- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.
- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.

#### Check out time by Gender and by weekdays

- Male users take approximately 3 times more rides than the female users.

- Most weekday rides are around 7:00 AM to 9 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- Weekend rides are highest from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.


### Summary 
The visualized data by this project is for the bike sharing in New York during the month of August 2019.
The far majority of the rides were taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours and shows that Manhattan Island is the most busy area for stating location. 
Additional analysis would be beneficial by :
- comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year,
- including weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides.
